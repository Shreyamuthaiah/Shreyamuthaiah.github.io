**Master's thesis: Optimizing Vendor Invoice Processes: A Document AI approach for efficient management**

**Abstract**

This study proposes a transformative approach to revolutionize traditional invoice management within the Accounts Payable area. Current manual processes, prone to errors and time-consuming corrections, hinder the efficiency of payment procedures. 

Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the conventional Vendor Invoice Management (VIM) method executed in SAP will significantly decrease the time spent on invoice preparation, extraction of invoice fields, and processing time, thereby enhancing overall payment processing efficiency. 

The focus is on leveraging the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to seamlessly integrate AI technologies, fostering a streamlined and accelerated invoicing process. Google Document AI offers a service that matches these requirements. By leveraging this functionality, minimal training is needed, as it comes with a pretrained model featuring Generative AI capability. This capability will significantly increase recognition and extraction accuracy, greatly benefiting the Accounts Payable team. 

The adoption of AI in invoice processing promises not only time savings but also a marked improvement in the accuracy and speed of payment procurement, ultimately advancing the financial workflow more efficiently.




**Slope Control of a mobile robot using Arduino NiclaVision**

**Abstract**

### **Advancements in Slope Detection Using Visual Systems**
Recent advancements in slope detection using visual systems have significantly improved accuracy and efficiency, thanks to cutting-edge algorithms and techniques. These methods enable precise slope identification across diverse environments.

### **Deep Learning for Slope Detection**
One example of a state-of-the-art method is **deep learning**, particularly **linear regression**. Sensors continuously provide positional data, which is then processed to calculate slopes. This data is compared with trained datasets to determine the actual slope of a **mobile robot**, ensuring optimal navigation and stability.

This project leverages AI-driven slope detection to enhance real-world applications in **robotics, autonomous systems, and terrain analysis**.
